Database Explanation:
Within the database, hosted on firebase, there are a series of json objects. An example of this structure is in the example.json file.

Each of these excuses and objects will be returned and generated to the user, by accessing API endpoints using the http address: `https://excuser.firebaseio.com/excuse/[genre]/[subgenre]`

For example:  to access an random excuse in the school genre, the API will use the endpoint `https://excuser.firebaseio.com/excuse/school`, then use the random function that uses Math.random() and a series of arrays, it will GET an excuse from the "school" object.

If you want to narrow the results to a specific subgenre, it will add that subgenre's name to the end of the endpoint, so the homework subgenre would access json objects from  `https://excuser.firebaseio.com/excuse/school/homework`.
